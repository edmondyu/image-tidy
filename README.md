# Toolbox (Client-Side Web Tools Suite)

This project is a collection of **browser-based tools** for working with images, PDFs, ebooks, text files, and royalty reports. All processing happens **entirely in the browser** (no server, no file upload), making it fast, privacy-friendly, and secure.

## 📖 Detailed Tool Documentation

### Image Compression Tool

**How it works:**
- Resizes images if `width > maxWidth` or `height > maxHeight`, scaling down proportionally
- Converts everything to **JPG** with initial quality `0.85`
- Iteratively compresses using `canvas.toBlob(...)`, starting at quality `0.8` and decreasing by `0.05`
- Stops when: compressed size ≤ `resized_size * (targetPercent / 100)` or quality ≤ `0.1`

**Parameters:**
- **Max width (px)**: Positive integer between 100 and 10000
- **Max height (px)**: Positive integer between 100 and 10000
- **Target size (% of resized)**: Integer between 1 and 100 (e.g., 50 = 50% of resized file size)

**Usage:**
1. Select `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.jpeg` files
2. Adjust max width, height, and target compression percentage
3. Click "Process Images"
4. Download individually or as a ZIP

### PDF to JPG Tool

**How it works:**
- Renders PDF pages to canvas using PDF.js
- Converts each page to JPG with automatic compression
- Targets <1.44M pixels and <300KB file size per image

**Parameters:**
- Export mode: First page only or all pages
- Automatic quality adjustment for optimal file size

**Usage:**
1. Select one or more PDF files
2. Choose export mode (first page or all pages)
3. Click "Convert to JPG"
4. Download all images as a ZIP

### Ebook Metadata Extractor

**How it works:**
- For EPUB: Parses OPF metadata files inside the ZIP archive
- For PDF: Extracts metadata from PDF info dictionary
- Collects title, author, publisher, ISBN, language, date, tags, comments, series

**Usage:**
1. Select EPUB and/or PDF files
2. Click "Extract Metadata"
3. Review extracted metadata in the table
4. Download all metadata as a CSV file

## 🚀 Deployment

Because these are static HTML files, you can deploy them almost anywhere:

### Netlify

1. Push this repo to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
2. In Netlify, choose **"New site from Git"**
3. Select the repo
4. Build command: *(leave blank)*
   Publish directory: `.`
5. Deploy and use the generated `*.netlify.app` URL

### GitHub Pages

1. Commit all files to your repo
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**
3. Set:
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main` (or your default) / root (`/`)
4. Save and open the provided URL when GitHub Pages finishes building

### Other Options

- **Vercel**: Import the repo and deploy (zero config needed)
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Connect your repo and deploy
- **Local use**: Simply open [index.html](index.html) in any modern browser
- **Self-hosted**: Copy all files to any web server

## ⚠️ Notes & Limitations

- **Client-side processing**: Performance depends on the user's browser and machine capabilities
- **Memory usage**: Very large files or huge batches may consume significant memory
- **Browser compatibility**: Requires a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari recommended)
- **PDF limitations**:
  - Text extraction only works on text-based PDFs (no OCR for scanned documents)
  - Very large PDFs may be slow to process
- **EPUB support**: Requires valid EPUB structure with OPF metadata files
- **File size**: Processing hundreds of large files simultaneously may cause performance issues
- **Privacy**: All processing is local, but files remain in browser memory during processing

### Customizing Tools

Each tool is self-contained in a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript. To modify a tool:

1. Open the relevant `.html` file
2. The `<script>` block at the bottom contains all the logic
3. Styling is in the `<style>` block in the `<head>`
4. Key functions vary by tool:
   - **Image Compression**: `resizeImageBrowser()`, `compressImageFromCanvas()`
   - **PDF to JPG**: PDF.js rendering, canvas conversion
   - **Ebook Metadata**: EPUB/PDF parsing, metadata extraction

### Adding New Tools

1. Create a new `.html` file following the existing pattern
2. Add a card entry in [index.html](index.html) linking to your tool
3. Use the established styling patterns for consistency
4. Keep all dependencies loaded via CDN for simplicity
